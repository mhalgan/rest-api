# REST API Template

The project structure is based on this [tutorial](https://codesquery.com/build-scalable-nodejs-restapi-using-expressjs/), but it goes further and aims to implement a reusable scalable REST API template with the following features:

1. Mocha+Chai automated tests
2. Winston logs
3. JWT security
4. Swagger documentation
